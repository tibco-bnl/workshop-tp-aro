# TIBCO Platform Topology Options

TIBCO Platform separates the management plane (Control Plane) from the runtime plane (Data Plane). This separation enables multiple deployment topologies — from fully SaaS-managed setups to entirely self-hosted configurations, and from greenfield cloud-native deployments to hybrid bridges over existing on-premises TIBCO middleware.

---

## Core Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Control Plane (CP)** | Centralized management: user catalog, subscription management, capability lifecycle, and aggregated monitoring |
| **Data Plane (DP)** | Runtime environment: hosts and executes BW, Flogo, and EMS capabilities; one per environment (staging/prod) |
| **Control Tower** | Specialized Data Plane that bridges the Control Plane to on-premises classic TIBCO middleware (BW5/BW6/EMS domain) |
| **Hybrid Proxy** | Outbound-only HTTPS channel from the Data Plane to the Control Plane — no inbound firewall rules required on the Data Plane side |
| **Observability** | Per-Data Plane stack: Elasticsearch (logs) and Prometheus + Grafana (metrics and dashboards) |

---

## Topology 1: SaaS Control Plane + Customer-Managed Data Planes

**TIBCO hosts and operates the Control Plane. The customer deploys and manages Data Planes in their own clusters.**

```mermaid

    subgraph SaaS["☁️ TIBCO Cloud — SaaS Control Plane"]
        CP["Control Plane\nUser Mgmt · Subscriptions · Lifecycle"]
    end

    subgraph Staging["🏢 Customer — Staging Cluster"]
        ProxyS["Hybrid Proxy"]
        DPS["Data Plane — Staging"]
        BWS["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoS["Flogo"]
        EMSS["EMS"]
        O11yS["Observability"]
        ProxyS --> DPS
        DPS --> BWS
        DPS --> FlogoS
        DPS --> EMSS
        DPS --> O11yS
    end

    subgraph Prod["🏢 Customer — Production Cluster"]
        ProxyP["Hybrid Proxy"]
        DPP["Data Plane — Production"]
        BWP["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoP["Flogo"]
        EMSP["EMS"]
        O11yP["Observability"]
        ProxyP --> DPP
        DPP --> BWP
        DPP --> FlogoP
        DPP --> EMSP
        DPP --> O11yP
    end

    CP <-->|"HTTPS outbound only"| ProxyS
    CP <-->|"HTTPS outbound only"| ProxyP
```

### Characteristics

- Control Plane is immediately available — no infrastructure provisioning required by the customer
- All workload data stays in the customer cluster; only management metadata flows to TIBCO Cloud
- Staging and production run on separate, independently managed customer clusters
- Each Data Plane hosts BW, Flogo, and EMS capabilities alongside its own Observability stack
- Hybrid Proxy establishes an outbound-only HTTPS connection — no inbound rules needed on the cluster

### When to Use

- Teams that want TIBCO to manage Control Plane infrastructure and upgrades
- Strict data residency requirements — workload data never leaves the customer environment
- Fastest time to value — the Control Plane is production-ready immediately
- Mixed cloud, multi-cloud, or on-premises Data Plane footprint managed from one SaaS dashboard

---

## Topology 2: Self-Hosted Control Plane + Co-Located Data Plane

**The customer hosts both Control Plane and Data Plane on the same cluster.**

This is the most common workshop and staging setup. It minimizes infrastructure footprint while preserving the CP/DP separation model. Staging and production each run on their own single cluster.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph StagingCluster["🏢 Staging Cluster — CP + DP co-located"]
        CPS["Control Plane"]
        DPS["Data Plane — Staging"]
        BWS["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoS["Flogo"]
        EMSS["EMS"]
        O11yS["Observability"]
        CPS <--> DPS
        DPS --> BWS
        DPS --> FlogoS
        DPS --> EMSS
        DPS --> O11yS
    end

    subgraph ProdCluster["🏢 Production Cluster — CP + DP co-located"]
        CPP["Control Plane"]
        DPP["Data Plane — Production"]
        BWP["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoP["Flogo"]
        EMSP["EMS"]
        O11yP["Observability"]
        CPP <--> DPP
        DPP --> BWP
        DPP --> FlogoP
        DPP --> EMSP
        DPP --> O11yP
    end
```

> Staging and production each have their own independent Control Plane + Data Plane on separate clusters. They do not share a Control Plane. This provides blast-radius isolation while keeping each cluster's footprint small.

### Characteristics

- Fewest clusters — one cluster per environment (staging, production)
- CP and DP communicate in-cluster without a Hybrid Proxy tunnel
- Suitable for workshops, development, and small-to-medium production environments
- Upgrading the CP and DP together reduces inter-cluster coordination

### When to Use

- Workshop and development environments
- Cost-sensitive staging setups where cluster consolidation is preferred
- Air-gapped or restricted-network environments where cross-cluster HTTPS is not available
- Small-scale production where simplicity is more important than strict plane separation

---

## Topology 3: Self-Hosted Control Plane + Separate Data Plane Clusters

**A dedicated Control Plane cluster manages separate staging and production Data Plane clusters via Hybrid Proxy.**

This is the recommended enterprise production topology. The CP cluster carries no customer workloads. Each DP cluster scales and fails independently.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph CPCluster["🏢 Control Plane Cluster (Dedicated)"]
        CP["Control Plane\nUser Mgmt · Subscriptions · Lifecycle"]
    end

    subgraph StagingCluster["🏢 Staging Data Plane Cluster"]
        ProxyS["Hybrid Proxy"]
        DPS["Data Plane — Staging"]
        BWS["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoS["Flogo"]
        EMSS["EMS"]
        O11yS["Observability"]
        ProxyS --> DPS
        DPS --> BWS
        DPS --> FlogoS
        DPS --> EMSS
        DPS --> O11yS
    end

    subgraph ProdCluster["🏢 Production Data Plane Cluster"]
        ProxyP["Hybrid Proxy"]
        DPP["Data Plane — Production"]
        BWP["BusinessWorks"]
        FlogoP["Flogo"]
        EMSP["EMS"]
        O11yP["Observability"]
        ProxyP --> DPP
        DPP --> BWP
        DPP --> FlogoP
        DPP --> EMSP
        DPP --> O11yP
    end

    CP <-->|"Hybrid Proxy / HTTPS"| ProxyS
    CP <-->|"Hybrid Proxy / HTTPS"| ProxyP
```

### Characteristics

- Complete isolation between CP, staging DP, and production DP
- CP cluster sized independently of workload clusters
- A single CP manages both staging and production Data Planes from one console
- Each DP cluster scales independently without affecting the Control Plane
- Production incidents are fully isolated from the CP and from staging
- Additional Data Planes (dev, QA, regional) connect to the same CP without adding CP clusters

### When to Use

- Enterprise production deployments requiring strict environment isolation
- Organizations where CP availability must be decoupled from workload cluster incidents
- Multiple teams sharing one Control Plane with per-team Data Plane namespaces
- Regulated industries requiring separate management and runtime planes
- Large-scale deployments with many concurrent BW, Flogo, and EMS applications

## Topology 4: Control Tower — On-Premises TIBCO Integration

**Control Tower is a specialized Data Plane that connects the TIBCO Platform Control Plane to existing on-premises classic TIBCO middleware (BW5/BW6/EMS domain).**

### What is Control Tower?

Control Tower is registered in the Control Plane like any other Data Plane. Instead of hosting cloud-native workload containers, it connects to and provides unified management visibility over:

- **BusinessWorks 5** — BW5 Administration Server and domains
- **BusinessWorks 6** — BW6 Administration Server and domains
- **TIBCO EMS** — EMS server installations running on-premises or on VMs

This allows a single TIBCO Platform Control Plane to provide one unified dashboard, lifecycle management, and monitoring view across both cloud-native Data Planes and legacy on-premises middleware.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph CP["☁️ Control Plane (SaaS or Self-Hosted)"]
        CPService["Control Plane\nUnified Dashboard · Policy · Lifecycle"]
    end

    subgraph CTCluster["🏢 Customer Kubernetes Cluster"]
        ProxyCT["Hybrid Proxy"]
        CT["Control Tower\n(Data Plane)"]
        ProxyCT --> CT
    end

    subgraph OnPrem["🏭 On-Premises TIBCO Environment"]
        BW5["BW5 Domain\nAdmin Server"]
        BW6["BW6 Domain\nAdmin Server"]
        EMS["TIBCO EMS\nServer"]
    end

    CPService <-->|"HTTPS outbound"| ProxyCT
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| BW5
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| BW6
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| EMS
```

### Hybrid: Control Tower + Cloud Data Plane

During cloud migration, Control Tower and a cloud-native Data Plane coexist under the same Control Plane, giving a single management view across legacy and modern workloads.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph CP["☁️ Control Plane (SaaS or Self-Hosted)"]
        CPService["Control Plane"]
    end

    subgraph CloudDPCluster["🏢 Cloud Data Plane Cluster"]
        ProxyDP["Hybrid Proxy"]
        DP["Data Plane — Cloud"]
        BW["BusinessWorks"]
        Flogo["Flogo"]
        EMS_C["EMS Cloud"]
        O11y["Observability"]
        ProxyDP --> DP
        DP --> BW
        DP --> Flogo
        DP --> EMS_C
        DP --> O11y
    end

    subgraph CTCluster["🏢 Control Tower Cluster"]
        ProxyCT["Hybrid Proxy"]
        CT["Control Tower"]
        ProxyCT --> CT
    end

    subgraph OnPrem["🏭 On-Premises TIBCO"]
        BW5["BW5 Domain"]
        BW6["BW6 Domain"]
        EMS_OP["EMS Server"]
    end

    CPService <-->|"HTTPS"| ProxyDP
    CPService <-->|"HTTPS"| ProxyCT
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| BW5
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| BW6
    CT <-->|"Internal network"| EMS_OP
```

### When to Use Control Tower

- Existing on-premises BW5/BW6/EMS investments that need centralized visibility without migration
- Gradual cloud migration — manage legacy and cloud-native workloads from one Control Plane
- Audit and compliance use cases requiring a single management interface across environments
- Organizations not ready to lift-and-shift existing TIBCO middleware to containers

## Platform-Specific Notes — Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)

All four topologies are supported on ARO.

### Ingress

ARO uses OpenShift **Routes** as the primary ingress mechanism. A wildcard Azure DNS A record pointing to the OpenShift Router external IP covers all routes across the cluster:

- Simplified DNS (recommended): `*.apps.<cluster-domain>` — one record covers CP and all Data Plane hostnames
- Split DNS (legacy): separate wildcard records for `cp1-my.*` and `cp1-tunnel.*` domains

For Topology 3 (dedicated CP cluster + separate DP clusters), each cluster has its own OpenShift Router IP and requires its own DNS wildcard record.

### Security Context Constraints (SCC)

ARO enforces OpenShift SCCs. The `tp-scc` SCC must be created and granted to TIBCO service accounts in every namespace before each Helm install:

```bash
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user tp-scc \
  system:serviceaccount:${CP_INSTANCE_ID}-ns:${CP_INSTANCE_ID}-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user tp-scc \
  system:serviceaccount:${CP_INSTANCE_ID}-ns:default
```

Control Tower on ARO also requires `tp-scc` for its Kubernetes cluster.

### Control Tower Connectivity

When Control Tower runs on an ARO cluster, it reaches on-premises BW5/BW6/EMS via:

- **Azure VNET peering** to the on-premises network
- **Azure VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** for private connectivity

No inbound firewall rules are needed from the on-premises side — Control Tower initiates all connections outbound.

### Observability

Elasticsearch on ARO (via ECK) requires the `anyuid` SCC for operator pods. Use `dp-config-es` from the TIBCO Helm repo for ARO-compatible Elasticsearch deployment. Prometheus/Grafana (`kube-prometheus-stack`) also requires `anyuid` on ARO.

### Storage Classes

| Use | Storage Class |
|-----|--------------|
| Block (RWO) | `managed-premium` (Azure Disk) |
| File (RWX) | `azure-files-sc` (Azure Files CSI) |

---

## Data Plane Capabilities Reference

Each cloud-native Data Plane can host the following capabilities:

| Capability | Description | Key Helm Charts |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BusinessWorks (BW6/BWCE)** | Container-native BW6 process engine | `tibco-cp-bw`, `bwprovisioner`, `dp-bwce-app` |
| **BusinessWorks 5** | BW5 engine in containers via BWCE compatibility layer | `bw5provisioner`, `dp-bw5ce-app` |
| **Flogo** | Low-code microservices and event-driven applications | `tibco-cp-flogo`, `flogoprovisioner`, `dp-flogo-app` |
| **EMS** | TIBCO Enterprise Message Service | `tibco-cp-ems`, `dp-ems-app` |
| **Observability** | Logs (Elasticsearch via ECK), metrics (Prometheus + Grafana) | `dp-config-es`, `kube-prometheus-stack` |
| **Developer Hub** | Self-service platform templates and automation flows | `tibco-cp-devhub`, `tibco-developer-hub` |
| **Hawk** | Process monitoring and alerting | `tibco-cp-hawk`, `tp-dp-hawk-console` |
